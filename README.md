# kdvsite

Hey there! This is the source code for my personal website. It's a simple static site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own site. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on **Discord (@kdv\_)** or using the contact page on the website âœ¨.
